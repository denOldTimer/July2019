## About the Project:

This is such a great project!

I created the project using Html, a Utility framework Tailwindcss ,jQuery and Font-Awesome. All nicely bundled using webpack.

The site is responsive and has two pages {Home, Menu} and a modal {Contact}.  
The contact submition nor validation functions.  
The menu is a paralax design and has three bg-images and three sections {The Beers, The Burgers, Side Dishes }.  
Some Images have been edited {2}. Images come assets, google and pexel.com.

I usualy don't partake in code challenges.  
This time I was learning Webpack, Tailwindcss and needed a learning project.  
I usally create webpack starter kits to learn more.  
You can find a few of them on my github repo @

You can find the source code for the project un bundled @

Thank you for the challenge.  
I really enjoyed doing it.

Kind regards denOldTimer
